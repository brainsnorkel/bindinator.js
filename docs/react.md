# React vs. b8r

I imagine a lot of potential users of `b8r` will be familiar with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
Below I've included the React __ToDo__ example along with the same thing implemented using `b8r`.

I've annotated both with comments discussing how the two differ.

## React Version

```
class TodoApp extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { items: [], text: '' };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
```

The first line is a consequence of React creating components via subclassing.

The whole classical inheritance pattern (even though under the hood Javascript
does prototypical inheritance) means that if a subclass fails to call an 
inherited method correctly things can go wrong, sometimes in subtle ways. 
It would be better if super(props) were a guaranteed behavior and the Component 
class had a virtual method that could be overridden for this purpose.

The last two lines exist solely because of React's need to pipe things around, even
within a component. More on this below.

```
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h3>TODO</h3>
        <TodoList items={this.state.items} />
        <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
```
Two lines of code that simply pass the parcel and rename it.
```
          <label htmlFor="new-todo">
            What needs to be done?
          </label>
          <input
            id="new-todo"
            onChange={this.handleChange}
```
Remember how we had `this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this)`
in the constructor? Well that's because doing the most obvious thing:
-- putting `this.handleChange` here -- won't work, because it's going to be
inserted in the virtual DOM element's props, and `this` will point at the
wrong thing, and the second most obvious thing -- putting `this.handleChange.bind(this)`
here -- is an _antipattern_ which is typically addressed by the linter screaming at
you that because react is constantly calling render, binding the method here runs 
the risk of leaking context like crazy.

If you want to know just how constantly react is calling `render`, put in a 
console.log and watch it run every time you hit a keyâ€¦
```
            value={this.state.text}
          />
          <button>
            Add #{this.state.items.length + 1}
          </button>
        </form>
      </div>
    );
  }

  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({ text: e.target.value });
  }
```
When the `<input>` changes, `handleChange` takes the value, sets `state.text` to that value, 
which triggers a `render` which tells the DOM to set the `<input>.value` to the
next value (which it already has, so never mind.)
```

  handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
```
An interesting case where `b8r` is less "vanilla" than React, which is especially interesting
since React has its own entire event system and `b8r` doesn't.

If we're going to have our own event system, why not make the common case (handle events ONCE) 
the default? But because React faitfully re-implements Javascript's default behavior (only
with synthetic events), we have to prevent that default behavior.

`b8r` leverages the browser's intrinsic event system, but always "captures" events and, by
default, halts propagation of an event when it has been handled once. (You can explicitly
return `true` from an event handler to have the event continue "bubbling").

`b8r` will stop an event that's been handled unless the handler explicitly returns `true`.
```
    if (!this.state.text.length) {
      return;
    }
```
In `b8r` we would disable the submit button with a simple binding. Allowing the user
to click the button but ignoring the click is a UI _antipattern_. Things that won't work
should look like they aren't working.
```
    const newItem = {
      text: this.state.text,
      id: Date.now()
```
We need to mock a unique `id` because rendering arrays correctly in React requires a unique
key value, and using the index is not efficient (if the array gets reordered). In `b8r` if you
don't have a unique key, you can use `_auto_` and `b8r` will create the unique ids for you.
```
    };
    this.setState(state => ({
      items: state.items.concat(newItem),
      text: ''
    }));
  }
}

class TodoList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.props.items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>{item.text}</li>
```
Here's where the "unique" `id` gets used.
```
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <TodoApp />,
  document.getElementById('todos-example')
);
```

The equivalent `b8r` ToDo list would look something like:

```
<h3>ToDo</h3>
<ul>
  <li data-list="_component_.list:_auto_" data-bind="text=.text"></li>
```
Note the use of `_auto_` to get `b8r` to auto-generate unique ids for the array elements.
If we wanted to do it the same was as React did, we'd generate `id` the same way and 
have `data-list="_component_.list:id"` here.
```
</ul>
```
Ordinarily, I wouldn't use a `<form>` element because the default behavior of forms is bad, but we're trying to be like the React example so I've put one in and blocked the default onsubmit behavior.

## b8r version

A `b8r` component is a single "html" file (it's more of an html `fragment`). The `<script>` tag ends up as the body of an `async` `load` function that gets passed a bunch of useful methods, including `get` and `set` which provide convenient access to a component's private data. `_component_` refers to the component's private data in bindings.

If a `b8r` component includes a `<style>` tag you can refer to the component's class -- 
`<component-name>-component` by default -- as `_component_` in the component's CSS selectors,
e.g. `._component_ { background: red; }`.
```
<form data-event="submit:_b8r_.stopEvent">
```
We don't want the form to reload the page. Ordinarily, I simply wouldn't use a `<form>` because
the default behavior of forms is pathological, and instead add 
`data-event="keydown(Enter):_component_.addItem"` to the `<input>` field (which would then
necessitate `addItem` exiting if `text` is empty.

If we wanted to _exactly_ replicate the React example, we'd add `data-event="submit:_component_.addItem"`
and then, like React, we'd have to exit if `text` were empty and we'd _still_ want to disable the
button for usability.
```
  <input
    placeholder="thing to do"
    data-bind="value=_component_.text"
  >
  <button 
    data-bind="enabled_if=_component_.text;text=Add #${_component_.nextItem}"
```
`b8r` allows the use of ES6-like interpolated strings in bindings, but it _does not allow_
arbitrary javascript, just insertion of data by path. The idea is _not_ to put business logic 
in the view or implement a Turing-complete templating language.
```
    data-event="click:_component_.addItem"
  ></button>
</form>
```
So you get the encapsulation of React's single-file component, along with the clean separation of presentation (style and html) from logic (script).
```
<script>
  set({
    list: [],
    text: '',
    nextItem: 1,
    addItem() {
      const {list, nextItem, text} = get()
      list.push({text})
      set({
        nextItem: nextItem + 1,
        list,
        text: ''
      })
    }
  })
</script>
```
Note how all the logic is in one place!

To actually use the component, we'd write:
```
<b8r-component path="path/to/todo-simple"></b8r-component>
```
Or, in "pure javascript", something like:
```
b8r.component('path/to/todo-simple').then(c => b8r.insertComponent(c, document.body))
```
That's it!
