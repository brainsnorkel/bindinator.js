# binding data

Keeping data consistent between an underlying data structure (or "model") and 
a user interface (or "view") is `b8r`'s job one.

`b8r` aims to provide a simple, robust set of tools for doing this.

## Anatomy of a Data-Binding

The basic form of a data binding is `data-bind="target=path.to.value"`.

```
<div data-bind="div=path.to.text"></div>
```

You can put **multiple bindings** in a single `data-bind` attribute, separated by semicolons.

```
<input type="checkbox" data-bind="
  checked=path.to.value;
  enabled_if=app.enable_stuff
">
```

You can put **multiple targets** on the target side of a binding, separated by commas.

```
<img data-bind="
  img=path.to.image_url;
  attr(alt),attr(aria-label)=path.to.description;
">
```

You can put **multiple values** into a binding, which only makes sense if you're using the `method()` target
(because the values will be passed as array to the method specified).

```
<div data-bind="method(path.to.fn)=path.to.x,path.to.y"></div>
```

Finally, you can put an *interpolated value* on the right side of a data-binding, e.g.

```
<div data-bind="text=${user.first} ${user.last}"></div>
```

This is intended to be familiar to Javascript programmers (it looks like interpolated strings in Javascript)
but be aware that all it does pull `b8r` paths -- code will not be executed.

## Targets

The most commonly used targets are:

- value -- used to bind to `<input>` and similar elements
- checked -- used to bind to `<input type="checkbox">` elements
- text -- used to render text safely into DOM elements
- format -- used to safely render text with simple markdown-style markup into DOM elements
- date -- used to render ISO dates using format strings
- enabled_if -- enables/disables control based on value
- disabled_if -- disables/enables control based on value
- attr -- sets element *markup* attributes (e.g. an `<img>` tag's `alt` attribute)
- prop -- sets element *javascript* properties (e.g. a `<video>` tag's `position` property)

Most targets are "to" only (i.e. when the underlying data changes the DOM is updated -- data goes "to" the view).

Where it makes sense (notably `value`, `checked`) the targets are "two-way", i.e. also "from", and the underlying
model is automatically updated when the user changes the view. This just works.

To learn about out all kinds of targets, as well as get more information about specific targets,
see the documentation for ["to targets"](#source=source/b8r.toTargets.js) 
and ["from targets"](#source=source/b8r.fromTargets.js)

## The Binding Hierarchy

A single element can have a `data-list`, `data-component`, and `data-bind` attribute. (It can also
have a `data-event` attribute for that matter.)

These bindings have a hierarchy -- that exact order -- i.e. the `data-list` binding is outermost
and is always resolved first, while the `data-bind` binding is the innermost and always resolved last.
Thus, `data-component` and `data-bind` bindings are "dormant" in a list-template, and `data-bind`
bindings are "dormant" in an unloaded component.

This means that you don't need concentric elements just to have a list of bound components.

## Lists

`b8r` provides extensive support for binding arrays to the DOM via the `data-list` attribute. Here's
a simple example which binds a list of objects, each with a `name` property to an unordered
list in the DOM.

    <ul>
      <li 
        data-list="path.to.list"
        data-bind="text=.name"
      ></li>
    </ul>

### Convenience Mathods

    b8r.getListInstance(element)

`b8r.getListInstance` retrieves the array element corresponding to the `[data-list-instance]`
the element belongs to.

    b8r.getListInstancePath(element)

`b8r.getListInstancePath` retrieves the data-path corresponding to the `[data-list-instance]`
the element belongs to.

    b8r.getListPath(element)

`b8r.getListPath` retrieves the data-path corresponding to the list of which the `[data-list-instance]`
is a member.

    b8r.removeListInstance(element)

`b8r.removeListInstance` removes the list member corresponding to the `[data-list-instance]`
and updates the DOM.

### Sorting, Filtering â€” Computed List Bindings

You can bind to a method (by path) so long as the method returns a filtered subset
of the source list, so:

    <ul>
      <li 
        data-list="path.to.filter(path.to.list):id-path"
        data-bind="text=.name"
      ></li>
    </ul>

Will allow you to dynamically filter, sort, or otherwise rearrange the source list.

The individual list instances will have paths derived from the source list, so
(for example) `path.to.list[uuid=9884698d-2f44-43a6-9c6f-30098e84f233]`. If no
id-path is provided, `b8r.bindList` will `throw` an exception.

### Under the Hood

Under the hood, `b8r` uses the DOM element with the `data-list` attribute as both a 
__template__ and a __bookmark__ within the DOM. For each element in the bound list
`b8r` will clone the template, remove its `data-list` attribute, add a `data-list-instance`
attribute with a `path` to the list element's corresponding data, and then `bindAll` the
list element.

These clones are inserted in order before the list template.

Assuming the `data-list` attribute is simply `path.to.list` the `data-list-instance`
attributes will be `path.to.list[0]`, `path.to.list[1]` and so on.

If an `id-path` is provided (see below), the path will use the `id-path`.

### Efficient List Updates

To help `b8r` update lists more efficiently, you can provide an `id-path` in a list binding.
Typically, the `id-path` will simply be the name of some guaranteed unique object property
from a service (e.g. `id`, `uuid`, `fooId`, or `foo_id`). This lets `b8r` ensure it can 
tell exactly which list instance corresponds to a given item in a source `Array`.

The format here is simply `data-list="path.to.list:id-path"`, e.g.

    <ul>
      <li 
        data-list="path.to.list:id"
        data-bind="text=.name"
      ></li>
    </ul>

Sometimes you'll have a list with no unique id (or you may wish not to use the id, so that
the user can, for example, add new items to the list without their round-tripping to the
service layer). In such cases you can specify an `_auto_` generated id.

    <ul>
      <li 
        data-list="path.to.list:_auto_"
        data-bind="text=.name"
      ></li>
    </ul>

### Annotating Empty Lists

If you want to provide feedback for an empty list, a list template (an element with the
`data-list` attribute) will have the class `-b8r-empty-list` if bound to an empty or
non-existent list.
