# nwjs

If you want to work in with b8r in **nwjs** you can simply 
download nwjs and install the application in your Applications folder (on macOS -- I haven't set things up for Windows / Linux yet; sorry) then run `nwjs.command`.

Because I like to use both nwjs and electron, the script will 
copy the nwjs package.json file from this directory to the 
b8r root before launching.
